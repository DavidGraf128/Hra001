Once upon a time, in a small time named Homton,
a young overconfident extroverted eagle
was showing of his superior acrobatic skills
but, it may have been fate, that he has been
sent plumiting down towards the ground by a
unidentifiable flying object
the eagle crashed into a routing module and
kickstarted our hero's wacky adventure!
