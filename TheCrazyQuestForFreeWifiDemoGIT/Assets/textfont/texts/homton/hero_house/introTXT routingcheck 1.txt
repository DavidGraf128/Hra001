So lets see what happened here, the routing seems damaged beyond repair
Wait is that an eagle?!
Your telling me that a eagle just flies into our routing box and smashes in to bits
Well, wouldn't be the first time, but what are the chances?
Oh the eagle is moving, thats cool I guess, at least its not that horrible.
Ok, lets get to business, and by business, I mean a long walk to the internet facility, I heard they replace these for free,
AND will finally give us Wi-Fi
