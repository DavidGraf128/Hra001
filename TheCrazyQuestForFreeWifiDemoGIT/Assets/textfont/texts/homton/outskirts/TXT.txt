Mornin Paul, how is it going?
Broken again, huh?
Thats unfortunate, but I reckon a young lad like you can fix it.
You need to go into town? Would give ya a lift but you know, I don't have a car.
There is a car right behind me you say? The Car shaped sprite is one of my favorite works of art, do you think it is convincing?
Well I know you do because you through it was a car.
