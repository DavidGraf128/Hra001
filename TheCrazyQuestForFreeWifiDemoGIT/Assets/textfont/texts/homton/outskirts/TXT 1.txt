What do you think about this new fence?
We can't see the dogs now, but they don't bark now that they can't see us.
Im on the fence about it to be honest.
Well, not litteraly as you can see, im not on the fence, but rather behind the fence.
And don't even get me started on the sign.
What a great ironic joke, it must have taken ages to figure out and refine to this point.
