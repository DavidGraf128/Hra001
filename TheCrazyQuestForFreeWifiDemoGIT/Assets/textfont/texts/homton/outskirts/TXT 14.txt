Look, Im sorry bout the elevator, it was old and as I can see didn't take you to the surface.
You need to go down here and then right, take the elevator and you will arive in our empty silo chambers.
Well they aren't empty really, they are occupied by a giant scorpion.
None of the workers could bear being near it and escaped, cept me.
I am determined in continuing to work but I can not defeat the scorpion, because I have emotional atachment to the scorpion, I even named it
Scorpi
He became violent and must be defeated, I think you're the lad for the job.
