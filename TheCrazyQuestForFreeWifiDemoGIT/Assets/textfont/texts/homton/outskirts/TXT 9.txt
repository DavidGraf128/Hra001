I am waiting for my dad when he gets back from the parking lot, he needed to park.
I wonder when he gets here, its taking a bit longer than I through...
But I am sure it won't take him longer than when he went to the store to get milk, that took a while.
He always comes back eventually tho, he only has 16 dollars.
